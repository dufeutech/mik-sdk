error: Oops! #[derive(Query)] needs named fields, not tuple fields.

       ❌ What you have (tuple struct):
       struct MyStruct(String, i32);

       ✅ What you need (named fields):
       #[derive(Query)]
       struct MyQuery { page: u32, limit: u32 }

       Named fields have names like 'id', 'name', 'email' - they make
       your code easier to read and work with JSON/query params.
