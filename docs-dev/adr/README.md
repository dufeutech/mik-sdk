# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant design decisions in mik-sdk.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures a single architectural decision along with its context and consequences. Each ADR is numbered and immutable once accepted (superseded ADRs link to their replacement).
